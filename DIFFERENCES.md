## üõ† Core Modifications

- **Configurable Behavior**  
  Added a full configuration system (`AutototemConfigManager`) to control features like effect checking, packet delay, and randomization.

- **Delay and Randomization**  
  Introduced a system to delay packet sending and optionally add random delays to mimic more natural behavior.

- **Advanced Slot Management**  
  Inventory scanning prioritizes inventory slots (9-35) over hotbar slots (0-8) when selecting a spare Totem of Undying.

- **Improved Packet Handling**  
  Packet sending is now delayed based on configuration instead of being instant. This reduces potential detection by anti-cheat systems and improves flexibility.

- **Enhanced Restocking Logic**  
  When restocking from inventory, a simulated item pickup and placement (via `ClickSlotC2SPacket`) is used to swap the Totem into the offhand slot cleanly.
